    - Designed and led development for a test chip to be used in corporation-wide process technology research; design was the most complex to be implemented on a test chip in team’s history
    - Influenced management to supply a multi-discipline team of three engineers to assist in test chip project execution in order to meet tight 6-month deadline and ensure highest quality standards
    - Built consensus between team and internal stakeholders who commissioned the test chip through weekly discussions about feasibility of features; led a rigorous final design review with customers and senior leadership
    - Persuaded multiple managers to expand personal responsibilities to a dual logical and physical design role; reduced time to converge design by 30%, and increased cross-functional knowledge sharing
    - Streamlined code-generation process that resulted in 50% reduction in engineering hours per week; maintained the code database which was used by over 60 engineers across three Intel projects
    - Converged functional unit blocks to design milestones across four Intel Xeon microprocessors and Omni-Path products; ramped up quickly on new projects to meet turnaround time of one to two months between milestones
    - Co-led the Women at Intel Network Hudson chapter: organized volunteer opportunities, professional development workshops and networking events, negotiated with corporate and site groups for over \$6K in funding
